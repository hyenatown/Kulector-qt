### Kulector is a super simple app designed to catalog your collections of stuff!

### This version is an attempt to work the Qt Framework into the original design, bringing the pun of this being called 'Kulector' full-circle.

### Primarily, qKulector is just a fun tinker project to bring it to KDE.
